# servicex-backend-tests

These are tests for the backends of IRIS-HEP's ServiceX. The intended functionality is to ensure that the xAOD and uproot transformers both correctly provide the same data.

# Requirements

All the tests require local working versions of ServiceX with both the xAOD and the uproot backends. 

# Execution

Navigate to the tests directory and use the command ``pytest`` to execute any of the desired tests.
